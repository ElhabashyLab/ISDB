Furthermore, while most CF strains are genotypically different from person to person, some clones are found in a large proportion of CF patients, indicating they are probably transmissible and are often more virulent. Such clones include the Australian Epidemic Strain-1 (AES-1) which infects 10-40% of patients attending CF clinics in eastern Australia. AES-1R is an acute infection isolate of AES-1 and as such its genome represents the initial infective phase of AES-1 which will likely yield vital information on the genetic characteristics of this epidemic strain.
