Interestingly, Aurora B phosphorylates S145 in a well-conserved motif of CREPT/RPRD1B. We proposed that phosphorylation of CREPT/RPRD1B by Aurora B is required for promoting the transcription of Cyclin B1"	SIGNOR-265499

It binds poly-Ub chains through its two Ub-interacting motifs (UIMs). We discovered that, unlike typical substrates of Ub ligases (E3s), S5a can be ubiquitinated by all E3s tested including multimeric and monomeric Ring finger E3s (MuRF1, Siah2, Parkin, APC, and SCF(betaTRCP1)), the U-box E3, CHIP, and HECT domain E3s (E6AP and Nedd4) when assayed with UbcH5 or related Ub-conjugating enzymes.The short half-life of S5a presumably is because of the presence of the UIM domain and reflects the ubiquitination of free S5a by many E3s. Surprisingly, the same four Lys residues on S5a, Lys-74, Lys-122, Lys-262, and Lys-365 were ubiquitinated by MuRF1 and E6AP (Fig. 10)."	SIGNOR-272740
